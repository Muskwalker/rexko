{"name":"Rexko","tagline":"A tool for making dictionaries","body":"Rexko is a project to develop a tool to create and publish dictionary data.  I have been using it for the past few years to create the entries for my Latin dictionary at [ttt.frath.net](http://ttt.frath.net/).  I have lately started using it for my constructed languages as well.\r\n\r\nCurrently it is not ready for public release, but I'm working on it.  The biggest hurdle as of just now is the utter lack of documentation of installation or use.  If you are adventurous you can give it a try.  ","google":"UA-42857528-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
